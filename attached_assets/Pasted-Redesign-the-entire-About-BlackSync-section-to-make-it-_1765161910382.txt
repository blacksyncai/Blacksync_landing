Redesign the entire About BlackSync section to make it visually striking and unique. Change the layout dramatically while keeping the same text content.

New layout direction:
- The headline and paragraph should become the central “core” node visually.
- Arrange the SIX automation modules around the text in a circular / radial flow layout.
- The modules are: Intake, Scheduling, Quoting, Payments, Communication, CRM.
- Connect these modules to the central text node using curved animated neon lines.
- The curved lines should animate slowly, showing a pulsing signal that moves from each module into the center node.
- The animation speed should be slow (6s cycle) to communicate stability, not hype.

Styling:
- Use the same dark grid background, but reduce its visibility so the graph stands out.
- Use a neon purple/blue glow style, but make it subtle and premium (reduce glow bloom by 25%).
- Each module box should have a floating depth shadow and soft inner glow.
- The center node (the text block) should have a very faint glow ring behind it to visually anchor it as the core of the system.
- All text stays exactly the same, do not change any words.

Graph placement:
- Arrange modules around the center like a network:
  Top left: Intake
  Top right: Scheduling
  Left middle: Communication
  Right middle: Quoting
  Bottom left: CRM
  Bottom right: Payments
- Use smooth, balanced bezier curves for connections.
- Everything should be symmetrically centered.

Hierarchy:
- The user should read the headline first, then the paragraph, and then visually explore the network around it.
- The modules should be visually secondary to the text content.
- The buttons should sit underneath the entire graph block with extra spacing.

Micro-details:
- Add a small label under the graph: “Automation Backbone” in 40% opacity, spaced lettering, centered.
- Slow down all pulse animations.
- Do not add any large glowing outlines around everything.
- Keep everything centered and clean.

Do not change:
- Any copy text
- Any wording
- Button labels
- Button positions relative to each other
- Color palette

The goal is a premium, futuristic automation network wrapped around the About section, not a flat UI diagram.
