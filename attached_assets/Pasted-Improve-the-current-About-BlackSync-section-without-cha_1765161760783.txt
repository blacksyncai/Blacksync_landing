Improve the current About BlackSync section without changing any wording or adding new content.

Keep everything exactly as it is, including:
- The headline
- The paragraph text
- The “Available Now” badge
- The two buttons
- The graph nodes: Intake, Scheduling, Quoting, Payments, Communication, CRM
- The grid background
- The neon blue/purple visual style

Do not introduce any new shapes, outlines, or large frames.

Make these specific improvements:

SPACING:
- Increase the vertical spacing between the paragraph text and the graph by 24px so the graph has more breathing room.
- Increase the vertical spacing between the graph and the buttons by 28px for a clean visual break.

GRAPH SIZE:
- Reduce each graph node size by about 10% so the text content remains the primary focus and the graph clearly sits underneath it.
- Keep all nodes centered horizontally under the paragraph.

GLOW:
- Reduce the glow intensity of the nodes by 20% for a premium deep-tech look instead of a gaming style.
- Keep the neon edges, just lower the bloom.
- Keep the purple/blue animated gradient, but make the animation more subtle.

ANIMATIONS:
- Slow down the pulse animation across the connecting lines to a 6-second cycle instead of a fast loop. Slow pulse communicates stability.
- Add a small pulse dot that travels along the path from Intake > Scheduling > Quoting > Payments > CRM > Communication every 6 seconds. The dot should be subtle, 6px size, soft glow.

ALIGNMENT:
- Make sure the graph is perfectly centered relative to the headline and paragraph, not based on approximate positioning.
- Check that the graph alignment is mathematically centered in the container.

MICRO TEXT:
- Under the graph and above the buttons, add a thin, subtle label in small uppercase text at 35% opacity:
  “BLACKSYNC — AUTOMATION BACKBONE”
  Letter spacing: wider spacing
  Font size small
  Center aligned

MICROCOPY:
- Keep the existing line “Automation you don’t have to think about.” but reduce its opacity to 60% and place it immediately below the buttons with 16px spacing.

BUTTON EMPHASIS:
- Slightly emphasize the “We build infrastructure.” button to make it a visual primary action:
  - Keep the same size
  - Add a subtle purple glow or brighter border compared to the “We don’t build chatbots.” button
  - Make sure this is subtle, not dramatic.

DO NOT:
- Do not move the headline or paragraph.
- Do not change any copy.
- Do not add new large shapes or background elements.
- Do not reposition the buttons horizontally.
- Do not change the grid background.
- Do not make any elements overlap each other.

Final goal: the section feels premium, spacious, centered, stable, and comfortable to view. The graph should look like a clean automation backbone sitting under the text, with slow movement and soft glow.
