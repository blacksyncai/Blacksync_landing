Redesign the entire "About BlackSync" section using the exact same text content with no changes to wording.

Design Goal:
Make the section feel comfortable, trustworthy, and reliable. The emotion we want is comfort — visitors should feel safe choosing BlackSync to run their operations.

Layout:
- Two-column layout
- The automation graph or visual system diagram on the left
- All text content on the right
- Vertically center the text relative to the graph
- Give the text max-width around 540px for calm reading
- Subtle spacing, generous padding, clean balance

Visual Style:
- Minimal, calm, and premium
- Soft grid background
- Remove harsh neon, heavy glows, loud colors
- Use muted blues/greys for nodes
- Soft edge glow (very subtle)
- Rounded module edges to feel friendly and stable
- Thin, clean connecting lines with soft curves
- Very slow pulse animation on lines and nodes
- Breathing animation that is calm (6+ second cycle)
- Equal spacing and alignment for a feeling of order and confidence
- Remove any sharp or aggressive visuals
- No large border box around the section

Content:
Keep all wording exactly the same:
Title: "About BlackSync"
Paragraph: "BlackSync builds AI operational systems — the automation backbone that runs intake, scheduling, quoting, follow-up, payments, CRM workflows, and customer communication."
Badge: "Available Now"
Buttons: "We don't build chatbots." and "We build infrastructure."
Do not change any words.

Microcopy:
Below the buttons, add a small line in low opacity:
"Automation you don’t have to think about."
(This reinforces comfort without changing your main description)

Motion:
- When the section scrolls into view:
  - nodes fade in slowly (staggered)
  - lines draw in smooth arcs
  - text slides in softly from the right
- Animation timing should be slow and smooth to create comfort, not hype
- No fast or aggressive animations

Responsive:
- On mobile and tablet, stack layout:
  - Text on top
  - Graph below
- Preserve calm spacing and centered alignment

Do not change any text content.
Only improve layout, spacing, visuals, and motion to create comfort and trust.
