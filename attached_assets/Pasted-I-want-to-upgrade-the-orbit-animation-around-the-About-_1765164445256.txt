I want to upgrade the orbit animation around the About BlackSync box.

Right now the component uses a single “OrbitDot” animation with offsetPath and a small radius. Replace that with a multi-orbit animation using a new component called OrbitCloud.

Follow these steps EXACTLY, with no creative changes:

1. Open the file:
client/src/components/AboutSyncCore.tsx

2. Find and completely delete the entire OrbitDot component definition, including its export.

3. Where the About box is wrapped (the relative container where OrbitDot was used), replace:
<OrbitDot />
with:
<OrbitCloud count={10} />

Make no other changes to layout or text.

4. In the same file (AboutSyncCore.tsx), directly below the AboutSyncCore component, implement a new component called OrbitCloud that renders 10 glowing dots orbiting the box at different radii.

OrbitCloud requirements:
- Use React + TypeScript + Framer Motion.
- Use Array.from({ length: count }) to create 10 ring configs.
- Each orbit config has:
  radius: 140 + i * 30,
  startAngle: Math.random() * 360,
  speed: 6 + Math.random() * 3,
  dotSize: 5 + Math.random() * 3.
- For each orbit, use a motion.div parent with rotation animation:
  initial={{ rotate: startAngle }}
  animate={{ rotate: 360 + startAngle }}
  transition={{ duration: speed, repeat: Infinity, ease: "linear" }}

- Inside each orbit, place a dot positioned at the top center:
  absolute, top offset = -dotSize/2, left 50%, translateX(-50%).

- The dot glows and changes color using a CSS keyframe animation:
  blue -> cyan -> purple -> blue loop.

Use a @keyframes neonColorShift block to animate background-color + box-shadow in 0%, 33%, 66%, 100% steps.

5. Make OrbitCloud absolutely positioned inside the same relative wrapper as the About box so the orbits remain centered. Example layer order:
- Black box: z-20
- OrbitCloud: z-10
- Background rings: z-0
Do not change the background rings.

6. Do NOT change any text content inside the About box.
Do NOT change font sizes, padding, or styles of the About box.
Only replace the orbit animation.

7. After you finish these changes, run the project and show me the About BlackSync section.

Do not add anything else. No refactoring. No redesign outside the orbit effect. Just implement OrbitCloud as described.
