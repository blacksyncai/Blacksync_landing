Build a next-level, official SaaS landing page for a software company called BlackSync AI.



BlackSync AI is a full-stack AI automation & virtual employee company.

We build voice agents, SMS agents, CRM automations, outbound follow-up engines, and AI plugins for real businesses.



Tone: confident, modern, slightly aggressive, but clean and professional.

Target audience: real businesses (real estate teams, clinics, home services, automotive, schools, agencies) that want AI employees, not just chatbots.

🖼 General Design & Style
Dark theme: deep charcoal / black background with subtle gradients.

Background: #050509 – #0B0D12 gradient.

Accent colors:

Electric blue: #2563EB

Neon teal: #22D3EE

Soft gold accent for important highlights: #FACC15

Fonts:

Headings: Poppins or Manrope, bold, tight letter spacing.

Body: Inter, clean and readable.

Style: Sleek, cinematic, “AI ops center” vibe.

Use glassmorphism cards, subtle glows, micro-animations, and smooth scrolling.

Include 3D:

Hero section should include a 3D object or scene (can be a placeholder Spline/Three.js embed) that looks like a glowing AI brain / cube / node network connected by lines.

This should visually represent that BlackSync plugs into phones, CRMs, calendars, websites, and workflows.

Add subtle scrolling animations: fade-in, slide-up, parallax elements, but keep it performant.

🔧 SECTION: “What BlackSync AI Actually Does”


Title:



Not a chatbot. A full-stack AI employee.


Short paragraph summarizing:



BlackSync AI builds AI employees that plug into your existing tools. They answer calls, send texts, update your CRM, send emails, follow up on quotes, and keep your pipeline moving while your team sleeps.


Show 3–4 feature cards in a responsive grid:

AI Voice & SMS Agents

Inbound Calls & Missed Calls

Texts & WhatsApp

CRM & Tasks

Email & Calendar

Web Forms & Chat Widgets



Each small card should describe:

“Call comes in → AI answers on 5th ring → qualifies → sends summary to CRM + SMS to team.”

“Lead fills form → AI sends text → books appointment → logs everything in CRM.”

“AI sends daily recap of new leads, hot conversations, missed calls, and follow-ups.”



Use connecting lines, glowing dots, and animations to make it feel alive.
