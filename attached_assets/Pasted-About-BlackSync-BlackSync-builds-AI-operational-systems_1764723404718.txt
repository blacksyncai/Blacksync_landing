About BlackSync

BlackSync builds AI operational systems — the automation backbone that runs intake, scheduling, quoting, follow-up, payments, CRM workflows, and customer communication.

We don’t build chatbots.
We build infrastructure.

Our multi-agent architecture replaces repetitive human workflows with autonomous AI systems that operate with speed, accuracy, and full integration into your data stack.

What We Power
AI Operators (Voice + Chat)

Autonomous, integrated, business-aware.

Real-time call handling

Lead qualification & routing

Scheduling logic & calendar control

Quote generation with pricing rules

Multi-channel follow-up (SMS, email, WhatsApp)

CRM updates & workflow triggers

These aren’t scripts.
These are operational agents.

Workflow Engines & System Automation

We build the internal engines that run daily operations:

Lead revival systems

Missed-call → SMS recovery

Automated payment & invoice flows

Data enrichment & pipeline cleanup

Routing, compliance, SLA logic

Multi-system syncing & reporting

Embedded business logic

Your operation becomes predictable, consistent, and fast.

Full-Stack Engineering

Beyond AI, we build:

Web & mobile applications

Custom CRMs & client portals

Scheduling & dispatch platforms

Payment infrastructures (Stripe, Qliq, QuickBooks)

Internal admin tools + BI dashboards

Deep API integrations (Zoho, Sierra, ServiceMonster, Odoo, Airtable, Supabase, etc.)

From idea → architecture → deployment.
BlackSync handles the entire stack.

Technology Backbone

Built on NVIDIA’s AI Foundry Stack:

NVIDIA NeMo

Industry-tuned models trained on real workflows, SOPs, pricing rules, CRM schemas, and operational data.

NVIDIA NIM

Every agent becomes a dedicated high-performance microservice (voice agents, schedulers, quoting engines, follow-up agents, collections bots).

NVIDIA DGX Cloud

Enterprise-grade training, fine-tuning, and multi-agent inference at scale.

BlackSync Orchestration Engine

Our router decides:

Who acts

What logic to apply

What data to update

Which system to trigger

This is what transforms AI from “assistant” → autonomous workforce.

Enterprise Data Infrastructure (Alpha Pro Partnership)

BlackSync partners with Alpha Pro Consulting, a leading enterprise data firm specializing in:

AI-driven data management

Cloud infrastructure

Cybersecurity

Data governance & compliance

High-volume ETL & pipelines

Enterprise consulting & staffing

This partnership allows BlackSync to operate inside enterprise environments with proper data controls, compliance, and scalability across MENA, Europe, and Africa.

Together, BlackSync + Alpha Pro deliver:

AI systems + the data backbone they run on

Secure, governed, enterprise-grade deployments

Zero-downtime integrations

Full Ops + full Data + full AI stack

This is the difference between an AI feature and a real enterprise system.

Who We Serve

Broad, powerful verticals — enterprise tone, SMB clarity:

Healthcare (clinics, rehab, patient intake operations)

Real Estate (teams, brokerages, ISA operations)

Automotive Services (repair shops, service networks)

Field Operations & Exterior Services

Education & Academies (inquiries, scheduling, enrollment)

Enterprise Teams needing custom AI + data infrastructure

Any organization running high-volume communication or repetitive workflows — BlackSync replaces 60–90% of that workload.

Philosophy

We don’t automate tasks.
We rebuild operations.

Systems > staff

Automation > repetition

Data > opinions

Intelligence > scripts

Infrastructure > features

BlackSync creates unfair operational leverage — the kind people notice.

The Future of Ops

The modern business runs on:

AI Intake

AI Scheduling

AI Quoting

AI Follow-Up

AI Collections

AI Data-Cleaning

AI Pipeline Management

All inside the BlackSync Operating System.

A true AI workforce — not a gimmick.
This is the new backbone of business operations.
And we’re engineering it now.
